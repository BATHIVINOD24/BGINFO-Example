# BGInfo Example

I use Bginfo at my work on some of my clients, some of them like to put info on desktop users... like disk usage, a calendar and some 
text or text for all the users.


##Scripts

### [bginfo.cmd](https://github.com/pacotudel/BGINFO-Example/blob/master/bginfo.cmd)
	Script to make the image that will be put on the user desktop.
	You have to put all of the tools and scripts on the c:\bin\bginfo folder and the user has to have write rights on this folder.

### [Make_Bginfo_Task.cmd](https://github.com/pacotudel/BGINFO-Example/blob/master/Make_Bginfo_Task.cmd)
	If you like to run this script hourly, this is for you :)
